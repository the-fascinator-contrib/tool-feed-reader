This code is a little unloved and may need some TLC to get it to work.

To run feed-reader:

mvn clean install
mvn -P<profile> exec:java

There are a few profiles, please refer to the pom. For example:

mvn -Pslashdot exec:java

You can also run the following if you want to specify your own blog feed:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="url=http://myblog/feed/ cache=target"

Notes:
 * For profiles: the Rome Fetcher cache is target/
  * To "reset" a feed, either delete the cache from 
    target or rerun the commands "mvn clean generate-sources install"
    
 * If cache is not set, ~/.feed-reader contains the cache
